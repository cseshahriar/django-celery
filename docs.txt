3. Why Celery?

Without Celery:
    * A single job application takes ~10 seconds (PDF + Upload + Email).
    * Users leave frustrated.
    * Django request threads are blocked, reducing server availability.

With Celery:
* Django returns immediately.
* Heavy lifting is done in the background.

process you’re setting up requires at least three services to run at the same time:
    * Producer: Your Django app
    * Message Broker: The Redis server
    * Consumer: Your Celery app

# Full Example of Task Lifecycle (with these enabled):
Task Queued → SENT → STARTED → SUCCESS
                        ↳ FAILURE

# celery start
python -m celery -A django_celery worker -E
python -m celery -A django_celery flower

Flower is a real-time web-based monitoring tool for Celery tasks. It helps you:

✅ See all running, pending, successful, and failed tasks
✅ Track task progress, retries, and execution time
✅ Monitor active workers
✅ Manually revoke, retry, or inspect tasks
✅ Visualize queues and workload
✅ View task arguments, results, and exceptions

It's like a dashboard for Celery — very helpful in both development and production.

   ├─ ✅ Store PDF in S3 (3s)
   └─ ✅ Send Email to HR + applicant (2s)

Celery for Django?
------------------
Celery is a 'distributed task queue' that allows you to run 'time-intensive tasks' in the 'background',
ensuring your Django app remains responsive.

Radis ?
--------------------
Redis acts as a message broker and can also serve as a results back end,
facilitating 'communication' between your 'Django app' and the 'Celery task queue'.

Celery Task Do?
-------------------
A Celery task performs operations asynchronously, allowing you to handle time-consuming processes in the background without blocking your Django app


What Celery Can Do ?
--------------------
Asynchronous Task Processing
Scheduled Tasks (Periodic)
Retry Failed Tasks
Chained or Grouped Tasks
Real-Time Processing
Task Monitoring


Celery Tasks
----------------------------
* Asynchronous Task Execution
* Distributed Task Queue
* Task Scheduling and Periodic Tasks
* Result Handling
* Error Handling and Retry Mechanism
* Monitoring and Management

Message Provider --> Message Broker --> Celery Worker --> Result Backend
Django            --> Redis             --> Celery         --> DB
Message Provider  --> Message Broker    --> Celery Worker  --> Result Backend
Django --> Redis --> Celery --> DB

Examples of Tasks
--------------------
Email & Notifications
File & Image Processing

⚙️ How Celery Works (Basic Flow)
--------------------------------
* You define a task (a Python function decorated with @shared_task).
* You call the task asynchronously using .delay() or .apply_async().
* A worker process (started via celery -A your_project worker) picks up the task from the broker.
* The broker (like Redis or RabbitMQ) is the message queue that passes tasks from Django to the worker.
* The worker executes the task, and optionally stores the result in a result backend (like Redis, DB).
* (Optional) You use Flower to monitor the task execution.

Common Celery Setup in Django
-----------------------------
    Broker: Redis or RabbitMQ
    Result Backend: Redis, Database, or other cache
    Task Queue: Celery
    Scheduler (optional): Celery Beat
    Monitoring (optional): Flower

What You Now Know:
--------------------
    How Celery works with Django using task queues
    How to send emails/SMS/WhatsApp asynchronously
    How to handle bulk messaging (like to 1000+ users)
    How to use .delay() and .apply_async()
    Basics of error handling, batching, and throttling


Step-by-Step in Django Admin:
* Go to Admin Panel → Interval Schedule → Add
* Set:
    Every: 2
    Period: Minutes
Save

* Go to Periodic Tasks → Add
* Set:
    Name: Print every 2 minutes
    Task: myapp.tasks.send_reminder ← replace with your actual task
    Interval: select the one you just created
    Enabled: ✅ Checked

Now send_reminder will run every 2 minutes.
